## Workflows

### Creating releases

Releases are shown in the tags section of the repository. A release can be triggered by simply tagging a commit in the repository.

### Using a CI/CD pipeline

This project uses Travis CI to manage CI/CD and builds. All pushes and pull requests trigger builds, but only tagging commits on master will trigger releases. The latest builds can be found under tags.
